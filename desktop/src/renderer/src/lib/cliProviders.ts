 * commands. The engine's `CLI_PROVIDER_CATALOG` owns all three, so a fourth
 * CLI provider — or `gemini-cli` being renamed to Antigravity while it keeps
 * its id — lands with no change on this side. A login command duplicated
 * here would go stale silently, which is the same class of bug that let a
