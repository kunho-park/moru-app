"""Local coding-CLI providers: Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Gemini CLI.

Each is registered as a LiteLLM custom provider, so the whole engine
addresses them with the same model-string contract as every hosted
provider (``claude-code/claude-sonnet-4-6``, ``codex/gpt-5.6-terra``,
``gemini-cli/gemini-3.5-flash``) and ``build_lm`` needs no special case.

Auth is the CLI's own OAuth grant read off disk — no API key, no login
flow of our own. See ``credentials`` for the stores.
