"""Antigravity CLI (`agy`) support: model listing and process invocation.

Antigravity is the successor to the `gemini` CLI. It keeps its OAuth session
in the OS keyring rather than a JSON file, which is why this module talks to
the binary instead of reading credentials: the CLI is the only authority on
its own session, and reimplementing Keychain / libsecret / Credential Manager
access would break the first time Google changed storage.

Everything asserted here was verified against the real binary (v1.1.22,
sha512 matched against Google's own release manifest) or its official docs;
nothing is inferred from the model names' shape.
