"""Bilingual display-name rendering: ``철 곡괭이 (Iron Pickaxe)``.

A *post-translation* transform. The compiled prompt artifact tells the
model to never append the English original in parentheses, and
``evalset/metrics.py`` scores against it, so the parenthetical must never
be asked of the model — it is derived here, deterministically, from the
already-translated value plus the source string. One translation run
therefore yields both variants: the plain pack and the bilingual pack are
the same data rendered twice, at no extra model cost.

Why only display names
----------------------
Appending the source to *every* string would double the length of every
tooltip, quest description, book page and dialogue line and make them
unreadable. The parenthetical only pays for itself on short noun-like
names, where it lets a player search JEI/REI/EMI and in-game search boxes
by either spelling and follow English-language guides and wikis.

The gate is three stages, each measured against the real vanilla 1.21.5
``en_us``/``ko_kr`` corpus (7159 translated keys):

1. **Prose exclusion** (:func:`_has_prose_segment`) — a key-segment sweep
   dropping anything under a prose field (``…tooltip``, ``…desc``,
   ``…lore``, ``…_description``) or inside a book/guide document. Removes
   52 vanilla entries that stages 2-3 would otherwise annotate, e.g.
   ``block.minecraft.spawner.desc1`` ("Interact with Spawn Egg:") and the
   banner-pattern ``.desc`` lines. Mod authors put descriptive text under
   item-shaped keys more often than a clean namespace model predicts, so
   this net is load-bearing rather than belt-and-braces.
2. **Name-namespace anchoring** (:func:`_is_display_name`) — the key's
   FIRST segment must be a display-name namespace
   (:data:`_NAME_HEAD_SEGMENTS`).
3. **Value guards** (:func:`should_annotate`) — identity, existing
   brackets, formatting codes, length.

Why the head is anchored instead of reusing ``is_name_entry``
-------------------------------------------------------------
``graph.is_name_entry`` is the engine's existing "is this a name" test and
was the obvious thing to reuse, but its ``NAME_KEY_RE.search`` matches a
name prefix *anywhere* in the key — correct for term mining, too loose
here. On the vanilla corpus it admits 848 entries that are not names:

- 831 ``subtitles.*`` sound-accessibility captions ("Anvil destroyed",
  "Beacon hums") — they match on ``.block.``/``.entity.`` mid-key.
- 17 ``argument.*`` / ``arguments.*`` / ``commands.*`` error messages
  ("Invalid name or UUID", "No entity was found") — they match on
  ``.entity.`` / ``.item.``.

Anchoring the head keeps all 2885 genuine names (block 1774, item 677,
entity 204, attribute 66, biome 65, enchantment 43, effect 40, creative
tab 16) and drops exactly those 848. The *value*-shape half of the
definition is still shared with the rest of the engine via
``term_miner.is_name_value``/``clean_text``, so "what a name-shaped value
looks like" has one owner.
