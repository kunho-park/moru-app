"""Installable output generation: resource pack + overrides.

The pipeline produces per-file translation maps; this module turns them
into the two artifacts a player actually installs:

- ``resourcepack/`` — ``pack.mcmeta`` plus ``assets/<ns>/lang/*``.
  Only *fresh* entries are written: language keys merge across packs at
  runtime, so re-shipping translations the modpack already contains is
  pure bloat — and worse, template-merging dumps would re-emit the
  English source for those keys, overriding the pack's own translations.
- ``overrides/`` — files a resource pack cannot carry (kubejs/, config/,
  scripts/, ftbquests/, patchouli_books/). They are copied over the
  modpack root and replace whole files, so they carry the *full* merged
  state (fresh + pre-existing target entries); a fresh-only file would
  wipe translations the modpack already shipped.

A file with no fresh entry is skipped entirely — the modpack already has
that translation. JAR-internal ``data/`` files would require patching the
mod ``.jar`` (unsupported); they are counted and skipped.
